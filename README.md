### Example

There is an example script in the `testScripts` directory.

### What can you do?

For now the options is:

-   Set variables of type string and number
-   Print variables and literals like numbers and texts.
-   Can run expressions like +, -, \*, \/, ^
-   When using a string:
    -   \+ : Appends to string
    -   \- : Removes from string
-   Can run comparative operations like
    -   <> : Not equal to
    -   \>= : Greater than or equal
    -   \> : Greater than
    -   < :Less then
    -   <= :Less then or equal
    -   = : equal
- The brackets symbolize priority of runtime
